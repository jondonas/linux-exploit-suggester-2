Usage  📖
==============

When run without arguments, the script performs a **'uname -r'** to grab the Linux operating system release version, and returns a list of possible exploits. Links to CVEs and applicable exploit POCs are included. Keep in mind that a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl
  Local Kernel: 4.4.0
  Searching among 73 exploits...

Use the **-k** flag to manually enter a wildcard for the kernel/operating system release version.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl -k 3
```

Use the **-d** flag to open a download menu to retrieve exploit code directly from Exploit DB. You can either download all exploits or select them individually by number.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl -d
