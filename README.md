Linux Exploit Suggester 2
=========================

Next-generation exploit suggester based on [Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/PenturaLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester)

Key Improvements Include:
* More exploits!
* Option to download exploit code directly from Exploit DB
* Accurate wildcard matching. This expands the scope of searchable exploits.
* Output colorization for easy viewing.
* And more to come!

This script is extremely useful for quickly finding privilege escalation vulnerabilities both in on-site and exam environments. 

Usage
==============

When run without arguments, the script performs a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux operating system release version, and returns a list of possible exploits. Links to CVEs and applicable exploit POCs are included. Keep in mind that a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl -k 3

Use the **-d** flag to open a download menu to retrieve exploit code directly from Exploit DB. You can either download all exploits or select them individually by number.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester-2.pl -d
